# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard!

Who doesn't love Big Bang Theory? Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was a fun game introduced by Sheldon Cooper. A new twist to the normal Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock to give an even chance of winning the game.

The code begins by defining values for the object that we are playing with.

This is followed by providing every possibility that can arise and providing conditions necessary to it.

The computer selects a random variable and then passes through the necessary conditions.

Type in your object, and VOILA!! There it is.
